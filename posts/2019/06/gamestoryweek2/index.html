<h2 id="instruction">Instruction</h2>

<p>Pick a popular story or film that you are very familiar with. You are encouraged to use the same story or film you used in the Week 1 assignment. If not, you may choose a new film or story, but pick one you need not watch again for the purposes of this assignment.
For this assignment, you are asked to begin fleshing out your selected film or story into a more detailed description for a possible game. You must include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Spine (logline) of the story, updated from last week.Story Synopsis of the film (200-400 words). <strong>Try to hit all 8 points of a good synopsis.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Character Brief for the protagonist AND the antagonist</strong> of your story (100-300 words each). Try to hit all <strong>6 points of what makes a good character description in each brief</strong>.</li>
<li>Though it isn’t covered this week, you are also welcome to submit a Setting Description (100-300 words) but this is optional. For now, feel free to outline the primary locations (2-3 maximum) where the story’s action takes place, and how a character would travel from one to the next.
Write all four components (spine, synopsis, and two character briefs) directly in each submission window. Include the Setting Description if you decide to complete it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the title of the story or film as your project title, and submit!</p>

<h2 id="review">Review</h2>

<h3 id="story-synopsis-points">Story Synopsis Points</h3>

<p>With a simple game, we can have a shorter and more direct story synopsis. In the case of Angry Birds, it becomes more about defining the overall world and story theme in the game. Understanding how we can put a story synopsis around Angry Birds will help you identify how to create a story description for other “simple” arcade skills-based games or begin to establish the basis for more complex games.
<strong>To review, did you see the following eight points made in the StarCraft II story synopsis?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>[x] Where are we; where/when does the story take place?</p></li>

<li><p>[x] Who are we following in the story (the protagonist) and why them?</p></li>

<li><p>[x] Who or what force is opposed to the hero of the story, and why are they in - opposition (the antagonist)?</p></li>

<li><p>[x] What do these characters want to accomplish; what is at stake for them?</p></li>

<li><p>[x] What is the ensuing conflict, and why does it exist?</p></li>

<li><p>[x] How does the action rise; how do things get more tense?</p></li>

<li><p>[x] What is the final crisis, and how does it play out?</p></li>

<li><p>[x] How do things resolve and wrap up?</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="about-character-briefs">About Character Briefs</h3>

<p>Understanding who your characters are is important to understanding your story and your game. In this lecture, we will take a closer look at the primary characters in StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty and break down their characters as exercise. Namely, we&rsquo;ll be making character lists and character briefs to describe who is in the story and what they do.<br />
<strong>To create your character briefs keep the following six points in mind:</strong></p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked disabled class="task-list-item"> Who is he/she? Are they a primary or secondary character and how do they relate to the game story?</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked disabled class="task-list-item"> What do they look like? What are they wearing or carrying with them?</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked disabled class="task-list-item"> What is their personality like and how does that personality help fulfill their role in the game story?</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked disabled class="task-list-item"> How do they relate to other characters in the game?</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked disabled class="task-list-item"> What are their strengths and weaknesses, and how can that affect the game story?</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked disabled class="task-list-item"> What are the motivating character goals for this character?</label></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="about-setting-descriptions">About Setting Descriptions</h3>

<p>Just as listing and describing your characters is important for a design document, so is presenting your settings and environments.
In these examples, we will take a closer look at the primary settings that we will include in our Game Design Document later. By outlining these ideas and settings in written form, we&rsquo;ll learn how the game creator can aid the designers and give a better overview of the world to readers of the Game Design document.
<strong>Create your settings description briefs with the following points in mind:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Where are we?</li>
<li>What does this place have to do with the game story?</li>
<li>How does this place relate to the characters?</li>
<li>Where did we come from and where does this place lead?</li>
<li>What does this setting look like?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>The Spine (logline) of the story</p>

<ul>
<li>Life in the United States, a high IQ, Korean father strive to find his missing daughter, with an agent who is the mother of the criminal. The agent try to misled him again and again, even assign another criminal convicted. However the father find his daughter through searching on google after her missing five days. Eventually, father and daughter reunion, agents and her son pay a price for their crime.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>A breakdown of the story into three acts. Your answer should consist of three paragraphs describing the actions of each act and how they rise and culminate to a resolution. (200-400 words)</p></li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><p>A Korean and his family lived happily and happily in the United States, but the disease suddenly took his wife away. Since then, his relationship with his daughter seems to be only superficial, but he did not realize it. Every week she lied to go to the piano class and cheated $100 from him. That day she said that she would attend a biological study group for the whole night, and she left at nine. After this day, she disappeared.</p></li>

<li><p>He tried every means to find his daughter&rsquo;s friend, but he found nothing, because she has no real friends. After some useless work, the father called the police. The female police officer who came to help him thought that her daughter’s departure was beacuse of religious organization, and the various evidences seemed to prove this. Every week, $100 was transferred to an anonymous account, no real friends, but one online. Over time, the new clues overturned the previous &ldquo;evidence&rdquo;. In this way, the relationship between the protagonist and the female police officer was also improved. Until he found the female police officer was always lying, and her wrong judgments, the protagonist learned the truth - the female police officer in order to defend the son who was the murder, took the risk, took the initiative to take the lead to mislead the protagonist, trying to cover up her son.</p></li>

<li><p>After discovering that the source of everything started after the female detective deliberately misled, the protagonist immediately called the police and concluded that the daughter was still waiting for the rescue at that place. After some search and rescue, her daughter was rescued. The female police officer and her son were put in jail and accepted the punishment they deserved.</p></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>A statement that describes your interest to this story/movie, or rather: Why does this story matter to you?<br />

<ul>
<li>表现形式十分新颖，不同于传统的电影，该剧90%的镜头都对着主角的电脑画面，这也反映了现代人的生活方式。剧情设计扑朔迷离，每次当我以为编剧是想反映某种社会问题时，电影突然又指向了另一条线索。反反复复的希望 - 破灭中，矛盾最终迎来了完满的解决。而且值得学习的是，每次另一条线索，在之前都会部一些微妙的暗子，因此每个转折并不显得突兀无理。</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
