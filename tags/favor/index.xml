      <description>World Design for Video Game - Week 1 Knowing what you like is a good thing. The point of this reflective assignment is to isolate and analyze the aspects of a game world that keep you playing and interested in the game.
To begin, pick one game (not a game series–just one game!) you feel strongly about. Use the title of the game as your project title. To help your peers, please include a reference URL to your game–a Wiki, an image, or the game itself.</description>
